# F1 Racer AI using Deep Q Learning
 F1 Racer AI using Deep Q Learning  Welcome to the F1 Racer AI project! This repository showcases an AI agent capable of racing in an F1 environment, trained using Deep Q Learning (DQL).
## Features 
* Deep Q Learning Implementation: Leveraging neural networks to approximate Q-values and make informed decisions in real-time. 	
* Exploration vs. Exploitation: Balancing exploration of new strategies with the Epslon Greedy Policy.
* Track Making: Tools for creating your own personal track to train on.
* Simulation Environment: A realistic F1 racing simulation environment for training and testing the AI. 	
* Reward System: Reward functions to encourage optimal racing behavior.
