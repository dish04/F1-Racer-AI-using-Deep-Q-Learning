# F1 Racer AI using Deep Q Learning
 F1 Racer AI using Deep Q Learning  Welcome to the F1 Racer AI project! This repository showcases an AI agent capable of racing in an F1 environment, trained using Deep Q Learning (DQL). Our goal is to develop a competitive racing agent that can navigate complex tracks, make strategic decisions, and improve over time through reinforcement learning.  Features  	•	Deep Q Learning Implementation: Leveraging neural networks to approximate Q-values and make informed decisions in real-time. 	•	Simulation Environment: A realistic F1 racing simulation environment for training and testing the AI. 	•	Reward System: Carefully designed reward functions to encourage optimal racing behavior. 	•	Exploration vs. Exploitation: Balancing exploration of new strategies with the exploitation of known successful tactics. 	•	Track Making: Tools for creating your own personal track to train on.
